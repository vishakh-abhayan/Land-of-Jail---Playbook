# First Week Strategy

{% hint style="danger" %}
**STOP!** Before you do anything else, read this entire guide. New players commonly waste thousands of diamonds in their first few hours.
{% endhint %}

## ⭐ Day 1 Critical Priorities

### 💎 The Golden Rule: Save Every Diamond

**Most Important Rule:** Never spend diamonds on speed-ups during tutorials or early construction.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="❌ Wrong Approach" %}
**What New Players Do:**

* Spend 500+ diamonds speeding up 10-minute builds
* Use diamonds for instant completions during tutorial
* Rush everything to "progress faster"

**Result:** Broke by day 3 with no permanent advantages
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="✅ Correct Approach" %}
**What Smart Players Do:**

* Let timers run naturally (start builds before logging off)
* Save every diamond for permanent upgrades
* Focus on understanding game mechanics first

**Result:** 10,000+ diamonds saved for game-changing purchases
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### 🔨 Priority #1: Second Builder (2,000 Diamonds)

Your **most important purchase** should be the permanent second builder.

**Why this is game-changing:**

* ⚡ **Doubles construction speed** - Build two things simultaneously
* 💰 **Saves hundreds of thousands of diamonds** over time
* 🏗️ **Interior + Exterior building** - Upgrade prison while expanding
* 🏆 **Competitive requirement** - Essential for keeping up with other players

{% hint style="success" %}
**Pro Calculation:** The second builder pays for itself after just 20 hours of construction time. Most players need 100+ hours of building in their first month.
{% endhint %}

## 🏗️ Building Priority System

### Phase 1: Survival (Days 1-3)

Focus on preventing riots and establishing basic income:

| Priority | Building        | Purpose               | Upgrade Level        |
| -------- | --------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1        | **Cafeteria**   | Prevents hunger riots | Level 3+             |
| 2        | **Shower Room** | Hygiene management    | Level 2+             |
| 3        | **Laundry**     | Cleanliness needs     | Level 2+             |
| 4        | **Guard Posts** | Basic security        | Match prisoner level |

### Phase 2: Growth (Days 4-7)

Optimize income and expand capacity:

| Priority | Building                    | Purpose                    | Target              |
| -------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1        | **Premium Vending Machine** | Primary income source      | Max level           |
| 2        | **Prison Cells**            | Accommodate more prisoners | +20 capacity        |
| 3        | **Work Areas**              | Prisoner labor income      | 2-3 different types |
| 4        | **Medical Bay**             | Reduce riot risk           | Level 1-2           |

## 💰 Resource Management Strategy

### Income Sources (Priority Order)

1. **Vending Machine** - Passive income, upgrade first
2. **Prisoner Work** - Active income from assignments
3. **Daily Missions** - Reliable resource bonuses
4. **Gift Codes** - Free diamonds and materials

### Smart Spending Formula

* **70% Essentials** - Food, security, riot prevention
* **20% Growth** - Income-generating upgrades
* **10% Emergency** - Repairs, crisis management

{% hint style="info" %}
**Income Rule:** Never expand prisoner capacity faster than your ability to feed, house, and secure them. Unhappy prisoners = riots = lost progress.
{% endhint %}

## 🚨 Riot Prevention System

Riots destroy your progress and waste precious resources. Prevent them with this checklist:

### Daily Maintenance

* [ ] **Food Supply** - Check cafeteria can serve all prisoners
* [ ] **Cleanliness** - Functional showers and laundry
* [ ] **Security** - Guard level ≥ prisoner level
* [ ] **Work Assignments** - Keep prisoners busy and earning

### Warning Signs

* Red unhappiness indicators on prisoners
* Overcrowded facilities
* Dirty or broken amenities
* Insufficient guard coverage

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Riot Recovery Costs:** A single riot can cost 5,000+ resources to repair and 2-3 days to fully recover. Prevention is 10x cheaper than cleanup.
{% endhint %}

## 📋 Week 1 Master Checklist

### Day 1-2

* [ ] Complete tutorial without spending diamonds on speed-ups
* [ ] Purchase second builder (2,000 diamonds)
* [ ] Build basic facilities: cafeteria, shower, laundry
* [ ] Establish initial guard coverage
* [ ] Redeem all available gift codes

### Day 3-4

* [ ] Upgrade vending machine to premium
* [ ] Capture first elite prisoner
* [ ] Join an active alliance (research first!)
* [ ] Set up basic prisoner work assignments

### Day 5-7

* [ ] Expand prison cell capacity by 20+
* [ ] Establish stable positive income
* [ ] Complete first fugitive hunt successfully
* [ ] Participate in first alliance activity
* [ ] Plan week 2 expansion strategy

## 🎯 Advanced Day 1 Tips

### Alliance Selection Strategy

Don't just join any alliance! Research first:

**Look for:**

* ✅ Active leadership (recent announcements)
* ✅ Balanced power level (not too weak/strong)
* ✅ Helpful members in chat
* ✅ Regular alliance events

**Avoid:**

* ❌ Dead/inactive alliances
* ❌ Toxic or unwelcoming members
* ❌ Alliances constantly at war (as beginner)
* ❌ No leadership structure

### Prisoner Management Psychology

Different prisoner types need different approaches:

**Low-Risk Prisoners:**

* Basic facilities sufficient
* Good for kitchen/cleaning work
* Low security requirements

**High-Risk Prisoners:**

* Need maximum security
* Higher work output when managed well
* Valuable but dangerous - worth the effort
