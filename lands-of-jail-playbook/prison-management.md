## 🏢 Facility Priority System

### 🔴 Critical Facilities (Build First)

These prevent riots and system collapse:

| Facility         | Purpose               | Priority Level | Upgrade Target       |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| **Cafeteria**    | Prevents hunger riots | 🔴 Critical    | Level 5+             |
| **Shower Room**  | Hygiene management    | 🔴 Critical    | Level 3+             |
| **Laundry**      | Cleanliness needs     | 🔴 Critical    | Level 3+             |
| **Guard Posts**  | Basic security        | 🔴 Critical    | Match prisoner level |
| **Prison Cells** | Housing capacity      | 🔴 Critical    | 20% over population  |

### 🟡 Important Facilities (Build Second)

These optimize efficiency and income:

| Facility            | Purpose               | Priority Level | Upgrade Target     |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| **Vending Machine** | Primary income        | 🟡 Important   | Premium + Max      |
| **Medical Bay**     | Health management     | 🟡 Important   | Level 2-3          |
| **Work Areas**      | Prisoner labor income | 🟡 Important   | 3+ different types |
| **Recreation Room** | Prisoner satisfaction | 🟡 Important   | Level 2+           |
| **Armory**          | Guard equipment       | 🟡 Important   | Level 2+           |

### 🟢 Optimization Facilities (Build Later)

These provide advanced benefits:

| Facility                  | Purpose               | Priority Level | Upgrade Target |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Surveillance Center**   | Security monitoring   | 🟢 Optimize    | Level 3+       |
| **Training Ground**       | Guard improvement     | 🟢 Optimize    | Level 2+       |
| **Specialized Workshops** | High-value production | 🟢 Optimize    | Various        |
| **Administrative Office** | Management bonuses    | 🟢 Optimize    | Max level      |

## 📐 Layout Design Principles

### 🎯 Centralized Design (Recommended)

**Core Concept:** Place prisoner cells in the center, with all services radiating outward.

```
    [Work] [Rec] [Work]
       \    |    /
[Shower]=[CELLS]=[Laundry]
       /    |    \
   [Medical][Cafeteria][Guards]
```

**Benefits:**

* ✅ Shorter travel times = happier prisoners
* ✅ Easier to guard and monitor
* ✅ Efficient resource distribution
* ✅ Scalable design for expansion

### 🛡️ Security Layers

**Layer 1: Perimeter Security**

* Outer walls with guard towers
* Single controlled entry/exit point
* Emergency response stations

**Layer 2: Internal Monitoring**

* Surveillance cameras at key intersections
* Guard patrols in all areas
* Metal detectors at facility boundaries

**Layer 3: Individual Security**

* Cell-level monitoring
* Personal guard assignments for high-risk prisoners
* Isolation units for troublemakers

### 🚶 Traffic Flow Optimization

**Design for Prisoner Movement:**

* Wide corridors (2+ tiles) for foot traffic
* Separate routes for different activities
* Minimize crossing paths to reduce conflicts
* Emergency evacuation routes

**Example Daily Flow:**

```
WAKE → SHOWER → CAFETERIA → WORK → RECREATION → CELLS
  ↑                                              ↓
  ← MEDICAL (as needed) ← LAUNDRY ← EXERCISE ←
```

## 👥 Prisoner Classification System

### 🟢 Low-Risk Prisoners

**Characteristics:**

* Cooperative and compliant
* Low escape risk
* Good work ethic

**Management Approach:**

* Basic security sufficient
* Best for kitchen/cleaning work
* Can handle group activities
* Minimal guard supervision needed

**Housing:** Standard cells, mixed population areas

### 🟡 Medium-Risk Prisoners

**Characteristics:**

* Occasional disciplinary issues
* Moderate security risk
* Variable work performance

**Management Approach:**

* Enhanced security measures
* Suitable for supervised work
* Limited group activities
* Regular behavioral monitoring

**Housing:** Standard cells with increased guard presence

### 🔴 High-Risk Prisoners

**Characteristics:**

* History of violence or escape attempts
* High security threat
* Challenging to manage

**Management Approach:**

* Maximum security protocols
* Individual or small group work only
* Restricted movement and activities
* Constant supervision required

**Housing:** High-security wing, reinforced cells

### ⭐ Elite Prisoners (Captured Fugitives)

**Characteristics:**

* Extremely valuable but dangerous
* Unique skills and abilities
* High escape risk and influence

**Management Approach:**

## 🚨 Riot Prevention & Management

### 📊 Riot Risk Factors

**High-Risk Indicators:**

* Overcrowded facilities (>95% capacity)
* Poor food quality or shortages
* Inadequate hygiene facilities
* Understaffed guard coverage
* Broken or dirty amenities
* Mixing incompatible prisoner types

### 🛡️ Prevention Strategies

**Daily Monitoring Checklist:**

* [ ] Food supply adequate for all prisoners
* [ ] Shower and laundry facilities functional
* [ ] Guard-to-prisoner ratio maintained
* [ ] Work assignments keeping prisoners busy
* [ ] Recreation time scheduled regularly
* [ ] Medical needs being addressed
* [ ] Facility cleanliness standards met

### ⚡ Emergency Response Protocol

**If Riot Occurs:**

1. **Immediate Response** (0-5 minutes)
   * Lock down affected areas
   * Deploy all available guards
   * Isolate ringleaders if identifiable
2. **Containment** (5-15 minutes)
   * Prevent spread to other areas
   * Secure critical facilities (armory, medical)
   * Evacuate non-essential staff
3. **Resolution** (15+ minutes)
   * Negotiate with prisoner representatives
   * Address immediate grievances if possible
   * Use force only as last resort
4. **Recovery** (Post-riot)
   * Assess and repair damage
   * Investigate root causes
   * Implement preventive measures
   * Discipline ringleaders appropriately

### 💰 Riot Cost Analysis

**Typical Riot Costs:**

* Facility damage: 5,000-15,000 coins
* Guard medical costs: 1,000-3,000 coins
* Lost productivity: 2-5 days
* Prisoner transfers: 500-2,000 coins
* Reputation damage: Reduced income for weeks

**Prevention Investment:**

* Upgraded facilities: 3,000-8,000 coins
* Additional guards: 1,000-2,500 coins monthly
* Better amenities: 2,000-5,000 coins

**ROI:** Every 1 coin spent on prevention saves 3-5 coins in riot costs.
